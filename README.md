# Neutral simulations of early tetrapod diversity

This repository contains code for running simulations using `pycoalescence` to understand patterns of early tetrapod diversity using ecological neutral theory.

It is intended to accompany the manuscript entitled "Early tetrapod diversification under neutral theory" (Dunne *et al*, 2022).

## Folder structure

- *01_simulation* contains the code for performing the neutral simulations on a high-performance cluster.
- *02_analysis* contains the code for performing the analysis of the neutral simulations and reproducing the figures found in the main text.
